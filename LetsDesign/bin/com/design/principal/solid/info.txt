SOLID Design Principle:

S ingle Responsibilty - one class should have one and only one responsibility
O pen/Closed Class - Class/Component should be open for extension but closed for modification
L iskov Substitution - Derived Types must be completely substituable for thier base types
I nterface Segregation - Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use.
D ependency Injection - injecting dependency to the application.
